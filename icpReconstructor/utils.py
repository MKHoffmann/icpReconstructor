        Finds the longest path through a skeletonized representation of a binary image. This function constructs a directed graph from the

        become directed edges. The function then calculates the longest path from a specified starting point to any node in the graph.
    
        The algorithm first identifies the closest skeleton pixel to an initial point and uses this as the starting node. It iteratively
        builds the graph by traversing the skeleton, adding edges from each node to its connected neighbors, while avoiding cycles. Finally,
        it utilizes the `dag_longest_path` method from `networkx` to determine the longest path in this directed acyclic graph (DAG).

        -------
        np.ndarray
            An array of skeleton pixels representing the longest path found in the skeleton. Each row in the array is a pixel's coordinates

    r"""
        Transforms 3D world coordinates into 2D pixel coordinates using camera calibration parameters and the CasADi library for
        numerical computations. This function is designed for applications in optimization and control where gradient computations are
        necessary. It performs coordinate transformations, normalization, distortion correction, and final projection using camera
        intrinsic parameters.
    
        This function leverages CasADi's symbolic capabilities to handle operations, making it suitable for scenarios where the
        derivatives of the transformation process are needed for further optimizations.
    
        .. note::
            The use of CasADi's `MX` data type and operations ensures that the function is compatible with CasADi's automatic differentiation,
            which is crucial for gradient-based optimization tasks in computer vision and robotics.

def spaceCarving(images, cam_params, x_bounds, y_bounds, z_bounds, resolution=0.001):
    r"""
        Performs space carving to reconstruct a 3D volume from multiple images based on visibility from different camera angles.
        This method incrementally carves away the volume by projecting grid points into each image and checking if they are visible
        in all images. Points that are visible in all images are retained, while others are discarded.
    
        The function uses a grid of points defined within specified bounds and checks these points against each provided image
        using camera parameters to project 3D points into 2D image coordinates. Points that project outside the image bounds or
        into areas that do not match the image data are considered occluded and are removed from consideration.

            A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the camera parameters needed by the `fromWorld2Img` function
            to project 3D points onto each corresponding image. The dictionaries contain A, dist, p, R, and T.
    
        x_bounds : tuple of float

        z_bounds : tuple of float
            The lower and upper bounds in the z-axis within which the space carving is performed.
    
        resolution : float, optional
            The resolution of the grid in all dimensions. Default is 0.001 units.
    
        Returns
        -------

            path : torch.Tensor
                A tensor containing the coordinates of the longest path found within the skeletonized grid. Useful for structural analysis.
            pts_3d : torch.Tensor
                The original point cloud derived from the space carving process before any skeletonization.
